There are many free mind mapping tools, such as FreeMind, that are a good option if you want to make basic mind maps. There are also some subscription-based online mind mapping tools which allow users to store maps on the internet for sharing and collaboration. Working online may prove a little cumbersome because it is dependent on your internet connection and some features, shortcuts and habits will be different from traditional desktop software. However, online mind mapping software makes it easy for an educational institution to provide remote access to students.
Storing mind maps containing confidential or sensitive information online could cause some security issues that conflict with company policies, GDPR compliance and educational regulations for storing student data. Please beware that some cloud solutions lure you in with free basic versions but charge on a monthly basis for the advanced features you may need.



There are many iPad, mobile and Tablet PC solutions available but they are yet to reach the standard of desktop applications when it comes to creating the basic mind map. As far as overviewing the map, small screen size is a problem even for average sized maps – which is basically the whole point! It will take some time and practice to master typing and capturing information on a small screen.
Commercial Mind Mapping Software


If you are planning to use mind mapping in a corporate environment, as a productivity tool, it is important to consider what the program allows you do with the mind map once you've created it. For example, can you convert your mind map into an outline in MS Word? Professional desktop applications typically integrate with MS Office which enables you to continue working with your ideas in other documents without re-entering data. You should always test the MS Office integration properly before selecting your tool. There is a big discrepancy in quality among the mind mapping software available on the market.
